# Naming things Alfred workflow

A workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) that helps when you need some inspiration to name things. I wrote a [blogpost](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/posts/2018/a-pair-of-helping-hands-when-naming-things) explaining how this helps me.

The workflow adds two keywords: `syn` to find synonyms and `assoc` to find associations.

## Synonyms

Opens your browser with a synonym search on [thesaurus.com](https://wordassociations.net/). Thesaurus allows you to click through to find synonyms of synonyms, and synonyms of synonyms of synonyms.

```
syn dog
```

Looks for synonyms of "dog" (pup, hound, mutt, tail-wagger,...)

## Associations

Opens your browser with a word association search on [wordassociations.net](https://wordassociations.net). Word Associations Network displays a list of—sometimes vaguely—related words which you can also endlessly click through.

```
assoc dog
```

Looks for associations of "dog" (cat, kennel, handler, rabbit,...)
